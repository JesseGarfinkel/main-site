          <h2>Why is Jesse running for state rep?</h2>
          <p>Jesse’s students used to have access to after-school programs. Then the Rauner budget disaster ended funding for those programs.</p>
          <p>These senseless budget cuts drove Jesse to take action. He's running for State Rep because our schools and social services deserve funding and fair treatment.</p>

            Political Reform and Restoring Our Democracy
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="political-reform">
            <p>Its no secret that Illinois has experienced demoralizing political corruption for generations.  We need to reform the system which keeps producing the same negative results and begin to restore our democracy. We simply cannot afford to wait for this change as millions of Illinois families continue to suffer due to longstanding political stagnation. There are many reforms that can be implemented right away to ameliorate this political blight.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Campaign Finance Reform</strong>
            <br/>
            <p>Perhaps the number one issue facing state and national politics is a broken campaign finance system that prioritizes money over people.  In recognition of this disturbing reality, my campaign has committed to taking no corporate or special interest money. We need to restore integrity in government and bring regular people into the political process again. We must make YOUR voice matter, not just that of Springfield insiders and special interests.</p>
            <p>This alone is not enough- we must fundamentally change the political system.  Even given the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Citizens United case, we can still effect major change at the state level through small-donor funded elections.  New York City’s Partial-Public Matching Program is a reform model that Illinois should embrace.  Such a program would reduce conflicts of interest and return power to where it belongs: with the people, and not moneyed interests.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Ranked Choice Voting</strong>
            <p>Ranked Choice Voting, which was recently approved by voters in Maine, has the potential to transform politics in many positive ways.  RCV has been shown to increase minority representation, make elections more civil, and allow third parties a greater chance to compete.  Most of all, it would give you more choices, allowing you to select the candidate who best matches your views without "wasting" your vote or helping your least favorite candidate.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Ending Gerrymandering</strong>
            <p>We need to end gerrymandering, which creates unequal and unfair representation at all levels of government.  Sadly, Illinois is a particularly notorious offender when it comes to drawing our districts along political lines.  Our districts should be drawn by an independent commission so that voters pick their lawmakers, not the other way around.</p>
            <p>Some have suggested that Illinois should not end its practice of gerrymandering, which helps Democrats in state, because Republicans in other states do the same thing.  However, there is a potential solution to this problem in the form of interstate compacts against unfair districting.  Illinois can lead by example, joining with other states, and starting the process of ending this heinous practice.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Other Measures to Increase Political Participation</strong>
            <p>We should do everything we can to ensure that all citizens can participate in the political process as both voters and candidates. Potential reforms to achieve this goal include making election day a statewide holiday, automatic voter registration, simplifying the state’s arcane ballot access rules and moving the date of primary elections from March to June, in order to allow candidates to share their message during warmer weather months.</p>
