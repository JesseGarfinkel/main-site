            Political Reform and Restoring Our Democracy
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="political-reform">
            <p>Its no secret that Illinois has experienced demoralizing political corruption for generations.  We need to reform the system which keeps producing the same negative results and begin to restore our democracy. We simply cannot afford to wait for this change as millions of Illinois families continue to suffer due to longstanding political stagnation. There are many reforms that can be implemented right away to ameliorate this political blight.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Campaign Finance Reform</strong>
            <br/>
            <p>Perhaps the number one issue facing state and national politics is a broken campaign finance system that prioritizes money over people.  In recognition of this disturbing reality, my campaign has committed to taking no corporate or special interest money. We need to restore integrity in government and bring regular people into the political process again. We must make YOUR voice matter, not just that of Springfield insiders and special interests.</p>
            <p>This alone is not enough- we must fundamentally change the political system.  Even given the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Citizens United case, we can still effect major change at the state level through small-donor funded elections. <a href="https://www.ced.org/blog/entry/new-york-city-partial-public-matching-program-a-model-of-successful-campaig">New York City’s Partial-Public Matching Program</a> is a reform model that Illinois should embrace.  Such a program would reduce conflicts of interest and return power to where it belongs: with the people, and not moneyed interests.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Ranked Choice Voting</strong>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE">Ranked Choice Voting</a>, which was recently approved by voters in Maine, has the potential to transform politics in many positive ways.  RCV has been shown to increase minority representation, make elections more civil, and allow third parties a greater chance to compete.  Most of all, it would give you more choices, allowing you to select the candidate who best matches your views without "wasting" your vote or helping your least favorite candidate.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Ending Gerrymandering</strong>
            <p>We need to end gerrymandering, which creates unequal and unfair representation at all levels of government.  Sadly, Illinois is a particularly notorious offender when it comes to drawing our districts along political lines.  Our districts should be drawn by an independent commission so that voters pick their lawmakers, not the other way around.</p>
            <p>Some have suggested that Illinois should not end its practice of gerrymandering, which helps Democrats in state, because Republicans in other states do the same thing.  However, there is a potential solution to this problem in the form of interstate compacts against unfair districting.  Illinois can lead by example, joining with other states, and starting the process of ending this heinous practice.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Other Measures to Increase Political Participation</strong>
            <p>We should do everything we can to ensure that all citizens can participate in the political process as both voters and candidates. Potential reforms to achieve this goal include making election day a statewide holiday, automatic voter registration, simplifying the state’s arcane ballot access rules and moving the date of primary elections from March to June, in order to allow candidates to share their message during warmer weather months.</p>

            Education
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="education">
            <p>My education platform is based on the idea that Illinois should have the best school system in the nation.  Every day, I see the amazing potential and promise of Chicago students, and it makes me both furious and heartbroken to see their futures compromised by political bickering. As a teacher in Chicago, I have firsthand knowledge of the challenges and potential solutions to improve our schools.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Fair Funding for Chicago’s Schools</strong>
            <p>Chicago students and taxpayers alike are victimized by the state’s current funding formula.  Chicago currently serves about 20% of the state’s students, but receives only 15% of total state education dollars.  It is unconscionable that our state representatives have allowed this to happen.  We need to fundamentally reform the state’s school funding formula to ensure Chicago receives equitable funding including state support for the Chicago Teachers Pension Fund.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Expanding Early Childhood Education</strong>
            <p>Early childhood education is widely known to improve students’ emotional development and future academic success.  Every family in Illinois should have access to high quality early childhood education.  The state should increase funding for Pre-K education to reduce class sizes and attract high quality educators to nurture our youngest minds. This is one investment that is an easy call, the benefits of which will be fully realized as students transition into the K-12 public school system.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Social and Emotional Support for Our Students</strong>
            <p>Many Chicago students face unimaginable hardships at home but still show up to school every day.  They are perhaps my greatest inspiration as a teacher.  We need to ensure that every student has access to high quality social and emotional support.  Access to counselors and social workers improves students’ emotional well being as well as academic performance.  Every school should possess the financial means to hire a full time counselor and social worker.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Recruiting the Best Teachers Possible</strong>
            <p>A good teacher can truly transform lives. Chicago has an opportunity to lead the nation in cultivating and compensating teachers.  Tuition for education preparation programs for future teachers should be completely tax deductible to ensure becoming a well-trained teacher is affordable.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Strengthening Neighborhood Schools</strong>
            <p>Our district is home to some of the finest elementary schools in the state.  These schools need to be able to function without a fear of crippling funding shortages and yearly labor disputes.  Our schools need dedicated funding streams without interference from local or state politicians.  I support an elected school board for Chicago to make certain that educational experts and voters dictate school policy, not politicians.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Charter Schools</strong>
            <p>Charter schools can play a positive role in our education system by innovating and pioneering new models of learning and teaching.  Many charters do this and serve low-income students admirably.  That said, charters should not serve to exert downward pressure on teacher wages and benefits.</p>
            <p>Given that they possess greater flexibility than traditional schools, charters should be held to higher proficiency and growth standards than other public schools.  In addition, if a locality deems it appropriate to shut down a failing charter school, it should have wide leeway to do so without interference from the state.</p>

            Fixing the Budget and Making the Economy Work for Everyone
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="economy">
            <p>Illinois’s ongoing budget crisis is an embarrassment to our citizens, and current members of our legislature should be ashamed.  Even worse, many of the most vulnerable members of society, including our children, have been needlessly harmed by political grandstanding.  I support the following reforms to fix this situation as quickly as possible.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Creating a Fair Tax Code</strong>
            <p>According to the nonpartisan Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, Illinois has the 5th most regressive taxation system in the country.  This is primarily due to our high sales tax and low, flat rate income tax. I will fight for the creation of a progressive income tax to restore fairness to our tax code.  This change will ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share, and allow us to raise much needed revenue to balance our budget without hurting lower income individuals.</p>
            <p>Illinois also needs to close myriad corporate tax loopholes, which cost the state upwards of $2 billion annually.  Many of these loopholes, such as the continental shelf exemption, provide no demonstrable economic benefit to the state, but exist as political gifts from dependent lawmakers.  Eliminating these loopholes will save the state money and ensure that all businesses are treated fairly in Illinois.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Making investments for our future</strong>
            <p>There are numerous areas where we can make investments in our future and ensure that our economy works for all Illinois residents.  Infrastructure improvements are vitally important to quality of life and public safety measures that would also help short-term employment in the state.  I support expanding the Illinois Enterprise Zone Program, which provides regulatory relief and tax incentives to help revitalize communities with high levels of persistent poverty.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Raising the Minimum Wage</strong>
            <p>I ardently support the passage of a living wage law to ensure that every full time worker in our state can afford basic necessities.  Such a law should be tailored to the price levels of the community in which a person lives so as to not adversely affect employment levels.  In addition, the living wage should be indexed to inflation and automatically adjusted each year.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Pension Reform</strong>
            <p>Anyone who serves the public should be commended for their service and properly compensated.  Unfortunately, our representatives made overly generous pension promises and failed to fully fund our pension funds for years, putting the state on the brink of insolvency.  We can no longer continue to kick the can down the road.  I support working with all stakeholders to find a permanent and sustainable solution to our pension crisis.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="toggle-issue issue_closed" data-issue="safety">
            Public Safety
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="safety">
            <p>We all suffer when there is violence and crime anywhere in Chicago.  People outside of Chicago do not see differences between violence on the south side and the north side.  Frankly, neither should we. The current violence ravaging Chicago is a public health crisis of extraordinary proportions.  In the past year alone, multiple students at my school have been shot.  It is unconscionable that our state government has not taken stronger action to address this problem.  The cuts to social services during the budget crisis have even contributed to a rise in crime in our district, as property crime in Lakeview is on the rise. In addition to improving our education system and implementing economic revitalization measures to attack the root causes of crime, there are public safety measures we must take to improve public safety.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Community Policing</strong>
            <p>Experts in law enforcement have extolled the virtue of community policing for years.  Police are most effective when they have the support of the communities in which they work.  We need police forces at all levels that understand and reflect the diversity of the neighborhoods in which they serve.  The state should support all local efforts to promote community policing by adequately funding these programs.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Stronger Gun Control and Gun Safety Measures</strong>
            <p>I fully support Illinois’s current gun control measures, including universal background checks and mandatory waiting periods. We should serve as a model for the nation on gun safety by giving local law enforcement broader discretion to deny concealed weapons permits and regulate gun dealers.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Increasing Penalties for Gun Crimes</strong>
            <p>Many studies have shown that increasing penalties for crimes committed with guns can reduce violent crime.  While I fully support efforts to reduce our prison population, we need to ensure that those who have committed crimes with guns do not continue to terrorize our communities.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="toggle-issue issue_closed" data-issue="justice">
            Criminal Justice Reform
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="justice">
            <p>With a prison population approaching 49,000 people and rampant racial and social inequalities present in sentencing, Illinois needs to take bold steps to reform our criminal justice system.  While I support the Illinois State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform’s goal of reducing the prison population 25% by 2025, there is much more we can do now to ensure all Illinois residents are treated equally under the law.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Racial equality in sentencing</strong>
            <p>Just three years ago, the ACLU found that in Illinois, non-violent Black offenders are sentenced to life in prison without parole at a 33-1 ratio as compared to similar white offenders.  This is just one example of an unconscionable racial disparity that threatens the integrity of our entire judicial system.  We need to work to ensure that race is not a factor in sentencing and hold judges accountable who do not follow this principle.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Getting Smart on Crime to Reduce Recidivism</strong>
            <p>It’s easy for a politician to say that we should get “tough on crime.”  Instead of sound bites, we need solutions that stop recidivism and ultimately improve crime rates more than traditional punishments.  We should move to decriminalize low-level drug usage and instead redirect people from prisons to drug treatment programs. A rehabilitative approach will address the root causes of addiction and crime, and break the cycle of incarceration that destroys families and costs taxpayers millions each year.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Policy Accountability</strong>
            <p>The overwhelming majority of police officers serve bravely and admirably, and we must make sure that good officers can report malfeasance without the fear of retaliation. In addition, we need to fund and require body cameras for law enforcement officers to ensure that all are held accountable.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Improved Training for Law Enforcement</strong>
            <p>We need to establish a police training program that improves law enforcement across our state.  Police officers should see themselves as guardians of the public rather than warriors in a combat zone.  This shift should include training in de-escalation scenarios whenever possible and training regarding humane interaction with people who have mental illnesses.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Marijuana Legalization</strong>
            <p>Illinois should join a growing number of states in legalizing marijuana for adults over the age of 21.  This would provide a much needed source of tax revenue for the state and allow responsible adults to make their own decisions without undue government interference.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="toggle-issue issue_closed" data-issue="lgbtq">
            LGBTQ Rights
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="lgbtq">
            <p>We should be proud that Illinois is considered a leader in LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign and other advocacy groups.  We must never waver in our commitment to equal rights for all of our residents regardless of sexual orientation or gender identification.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Enshrining Equal Protection in the State Constitution</strong>
            <p>With assaults on equal rights coming from the new presidential administration, it is vital that Illinois legally protects the LGBTQ population in the strongest possible way we can.  Sexual orientation and gender identification should be protected classes in our state constitution.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Anti-discrimination Laws</strong>
            <p>I strongly support anti-discrimination laws in all areas of public life including housing, health care, hiring, and education.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Transgender Rights</strong>
            <p>There is still room for Illinois to improve its laws protecting the transgender community.  We need to join California, New York, and the 6 other states who offer transgender-inclusive health benefits for state employees. We should also ensure that state law facilitates gender marker change on birth certificates.  In addition to these measures, I support our state’s measures to protect transgender individuals under hate crime statutes.</p>

          <div class="issue_details" id="womens-rights">
            <p>I am a proud feminist and support using whatever legal measures are necessary to ensure equal rights for women.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Protecting Choice</strong>
            <p>The government should have no role in regulating a woman’s right to choose. I support all efforts to ensure that this right is not jeopardized by federal actions.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Closing the Gender Pay Gap</strong>
            <p>One of the most persistent and troubling issues our country faces is the fact that the median salary for female workers remains only 80% of that for male workers.  We must attack this problem in multiple ways.</p>
            <p>First, Illinois must join the three other states that guarantee all women paid maternity leave. Women should not have to choose between motherhood and their careers.  A more comprehensive policy in this area would also guarantee paid paternity leave so that fathers can more equally share the burden of caring for a new child.  Second, we must increase educational and career opportunities for women in high paying fields such as science, technology, math, and engineering.  Finally, we must ensure that pay discrimination based on gender is finally eradicated from our state through vigorous enforcement.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Ensuring Access to Healthcare</strong>
            <p>Illinois should continue to fund Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide vital healthcare services to women.  It should not be a partisan issue to ensure that women of all income levels have access to adequate healthcare.</p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="toggle-issue issue_closed" data-issue="energy">
            Energy and The Environment
          </h3>
          <div class="issue_details" id="energy">
            <p>Illinois should be a leader in fighting climate change and developing clean, renewable energy.  Clean air and water is a public good and should be treated as such.  Corporations should not have to be bribed in order to stop polluting our environment.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Carbon Tax and Rebate Plan</strong>
            <p>Economists and environmentalists alike agree that a carbon tax is the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The revenue from these taxes could be returned to taxpayers, who largely bear the cost of pollution, in the form of rebates. Last year, for example, the California Legislature passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to enact such a program, and Illinois should follow their lead.  If the Federal Government does not act on this proposal, Illinois should join with other states to enact this legislation.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Promoting Renewable Energy and Efficiency</strong>
            <p>Illinois should join our neighbor to the west, Iowa, in promoting renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.  Utilities should not be able to block solar installation, and we should protect net metering, which allows residential production of power for financial credit.  Finally, we should provide robust incentives for consumers to increase home energy efficiency.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Increasing Emissions Standards for Automobiles</strong>
            <p>Illinois should join the 13 other states that have adopted California’s stricter vehicle emissions standards.  Furthermore, Illinois should expand tax credits for purchasing low emission vehicles and wave all registration fees on such vehicles.</p>

            <strong>Restoring Funding to Social Service Providers</strong>
            <p>One of the worst effects of the state budget crisis has been cuts to social service providers who provide vital support to our seniors.  Even AARP has expressed their disgust with the current state of events in Illinois.  We need to pass a budget to ensure that social service providers have the funds they need to support our senior citizens.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Protecting Medicare</strong>
            <p>I will fight to protect Medicare against cuts from the Federal government.  Seniors who have paid into the system their entire lives should not see their benefits diminished.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs</strong>
            <p>Illinois should allow citizens to import drugs from Canada in order to achieve cost savings.  We have had such a program in the past and should educate our residents regarding how they can save money this way.  In addition, I support fully funding the Illinois Cares Rx Program, which provides vital support to many seniors.</p>

            <p>Illinois should support programs for those who find themselves in need of short term financial support to maintain their housing.  This policy is not only humane, but also financially prudent as it would prevent the expense of unnecessary foreclosures and evictions.</p>

            <strong>Immigration and Refugees</strong>
            <p>Immigrants make America great.  Illinois should welcome immigrants and resist federal efforts to deport law-abiding residents. In addition to this, I will fight for the immigrant services line item in our budget against devastating cuts proposed by the governor.</p>
            <p>Accepting refugees is not only the humane and moral thing to do, but also improves America’s image around the world.  I strongly support making our state a safe haven for refugees.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Medicaid Reform</strong>
            <p>Medicaid is one of the largest items in our state budget and thus can be a key source of cost savings without compromising care.  We should follow the example of the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers and provide personalized care to those utilizing the system the most. This will save money by decreasing expensive emergency room visits while still improving health outcomes.</p>
            <br/>
            <strong>Legalization and Regulation of Online Poker</strong>
            <p>Illinois should join the three other states which have legalized online poker.  A ban on this game of skill is an undue government interference in citizens’ private lives.  Furthermore, taxation of online poker sites could potentially bring the state hundreds of millions of dollars in much needed tax revenues.</p>
