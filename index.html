          <h1>Message from Jesse</h1>
          <p>After deep reflection and many discussions with my family, campaign staff, and supporters, I have made the tough decision to suspend my campaign for state representative. This was an extremely difficult choice, but I believe it is the right one at this time.</p>
          <p>A lot has changed since I began this journey: my wife and I welcomed a beautiful baby girl, I started teaching at a new school, and our country now faces an existential challenge to our democracy emanating from its highest offices. For several reasons I’ll explain here, I came to the conclusion that my supporters’ and my energy would be better focused advocating for change in ways other than this campaign.</p>
          <p>There were three major factors in this decision. First, despite the generosity of over 150 donors (the median donation was $50), we felt that we would be unable to fund our campaign appropriately all the way to election day. Second, as I previously stated, my life circumstances have changed tremendously since this campaign was conceived, and I increasingly found myself unable to fulfill my responsibilities as a father, husband, teacher, and candidate to a standard which the people in my life deserve. Finally, the political dynamics in our state and country have shifted considerably over the past year. The relentless attacks on our government from many on the right have only intensified, necessitating a united front to defend our democracy and ensure that campaign resources go where they are most needed.</p>
          <p>What hasn’t changed is my passion for raising the voices of ordinary people in our community and pushing for positive change.</p>
          <p>Over the course of this campaign, my team knocked on thousands of doors, had hundreds of conversations, and mobilized dozens of volunteers. We engaged first time voters, long-time community members, elected officials, and experienced political campaigners. We talked about the most difficult issues and listened -- really listened -- to our community members.</p>
          <p>After reaching my decision, I contacted Representative Feigenholtz. She expressed respect for the momentum we’ve built and the issues we’ve brought to light. We decided to work together on an issue that has been my life’s work to this point, education. Together, we will form an Education Advisory Committee for the 12th District. We’ll bring together teachers, principals, community leaders, parents, and other stakeholders in Chicago to work toward improving our local schools through issues such as advocating for an elected school board. More news on the Committee to follow soon.</p>
          <p>Thank you to my amazing staff and those who volunteered their time and donated funds to support this campaign. I’ll never forget the energy, and encouragement you gave me and our movement. Thank you to the friends who advised me throughout this process. Finally, thank you to my family, particularly my amazing wife, Maggie, for supporting me in every possible way I could imagine. This has been a truly people powered endeavor, and this is just the beginning.</p>
          <p>All My Best,</p>
          <p>Jesse</p>
