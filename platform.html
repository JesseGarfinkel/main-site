        <h2>Fix Our State</h2>
        <p>Anyone who knows a bit about Illinois history is aware that our state has experienced demoralizing political corruption.  We need to change the system which keeps producing the same negative results.  While such an endeavor can sometimes seem hopeless, there are reforms we can implement right now to begin to restore our democracy.</p>
        <h3>Campaign Finance Reform</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the number one issue facing our state and national politics is a broken campaign finance system which prioritizes money over people.  In recognition of this fact, my campaign has committed to taking no corporate, special interest, or PAC money. We need to bring regular people into the political process again. It’s about making YOUR voice matter, not just Springfield insiders and special interests.</p>
        <p>This alone is not enough- we must fundamentally change the system.  Even given the Supreme   Court’s ruling in the Citizens United case, we can still effect major change at the state level through small donor funded elections.  New York City’s Partial-Public Matching Program is a reform model that Illinois should embrace.  Such a program would return power where it belongs: with the people, not moneyed interests.</p>
        <h3>Ranked Choice Voting</h3>
        <p>Ranked Choice Voting, which was recently passed by voters in Maine, has the potential transform politics in many positive ways.  RCV has been shown to increase minority representation, make elections more civil, and allow third parties a chance to compete.  Most of all, it would give you more choices to select the candidate who best matches your views without "wasting" your vote or helping your least favorite candidate.</p>
        <h3>Ending Gerrymandering</h3>
        <p>We need to end gerrymandering which creates unequal and unfair representation at all levels of government.  Sadly, Illinois is a particularly notorious offender in this area.  Our districts should be drawn by an independent commission so that voters pick their lawmakers, not the other way around.</p>
        <p>Some have suggested that Illinois should not end its practice of gerrymandering, which helps Democrats here, because Republicans in other states do the same thing.  While I am not proposing unilaterally disadvantaging our party, there is a potential solution to this problem in the form of interstate compacts against unfair districting.  Illinois can lead by example, join with other states, and start the process of ending this heinous practice.</p>

        <h2>Fund Our Schools</h2>
        <p>My education platform is based on the idea that Illinois should have the best school system in the nation.  As a teacher in Chicago, I am intimately aware of the challenges and potential solutions to fixing our schools.</p>

        <h3>Fair Funding for Chicago’s Schools</h3>
        <p>Chicago students and taxpayers alike are victimized by the state’s current funding formula.  Chicago currently serves about 20% of the state’s students, but receives only 15% of total state education dollars.  It is unconscionable that our state representatives have allowed this to happen.  We need to fundamentally reform the state’s school funding formula to ensure we receive equitable funding.</p>
        <h3>Recruiting the Best Teachers Possible</h3>
        <p>Chicago has an opportunity to lead the nation in cultivating and compensating teachers.  Tuition for education preparation programs for future teachers should be completely tax deductible to make becoming a well-trained teacher more affordable.</p>
        <p>Teachers in the United States are grossly undercompensated compared to others with similar levels of education.  To attract and retain the best teachers possible, we need to greatly increase starting salaries for teachers.</p>

        <h3>Strengthening Neighborhood Schools</h3>
        <p>Our district is home to some of the finest elementary schools in the state.  These schools need to be able to function without fearing crippling funding shortages and labor disputes virtually every year.  Our schools need dedicated funding streams without interference from local or state politicians.</p>

        <p>I support an elected school board for Chicago to make that educational experts and voters dictate school policy, not politicians.  In addition, I will fight to ensure that tax dollars intended for the classroom do not end up elsewhere, as has been commonplace in Chicago over the years.</p>

        <h3>Charter Schools</h3>
        <p>Charter schools can play a positive role in our education system through innovation and pioneering new models of teaching.  Many charters do this and serve low-income students admirably.  With that said, charters should not serve to undercut teachers’ unions or put downward pressure on teacher wages and benefits.</p>

        <p>Given that they have greater flexibility than traditional schools, charters should be held to higher proficiency and growth standards than other public schools.  In addition, if a locality deems it appropriate to shut down a failing charter school, it should have wide leeway to do so without interference from the state.</p>
